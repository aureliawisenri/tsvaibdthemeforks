# t'svai's bd theme fork repo

As (partially) noted in the repo description these are all self-customized versions of betterdiscord themes that are reuploaded for use on vencord. 

It's all betterdiscord currently (and actually one theme currently) but could potentially end up including other sources as well. 

I don't actually expect/intend for anyone else to look at this or use it, but I dumped this readme here anyway in case anyone stumbles across it. 
This repo is currently private but it'll be switched to public if I run into any issues with theme functionality. I'm extremely new to actually operating a repo and my skill level is approximately stinky baby, so I'm doing this by the seat of my pants. 

**Disclaimer:** All edited and reuploaded themes will still have the sources & credits in the css as originally put there by their creators. I have done my best to check licenses before saving and reuploading to make sure they permit distribution and/or private use. 

*All themes are bound by the original/term licenses of the repos they were sourced from.*
