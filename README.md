# t'svai's theme & theme asset repo

while i'm still using vencord on pc, i'm now also using revenge on android, which doesn't support local themes, so i'm back to hosting themes in this repo as well. 
i've more accurately renamed the repo itself as well, as i should have before.

~~For a while now, vencord has been able to use local themes instead of exclusively online themes, so I no longer need this as a theme css repo, and am now using it to host assets for any themes that use images (background themes, etc).~~

**Disclaimer:** All edited and reuploaded themes will still have the sources & credits in the css as originally put there by their creators. I have done my best to check licenses before saving and reuploading to make sure they permit distribution and/or private use. 

*All themes are bound by the original/term licenses of the repos they were sourced from.*
