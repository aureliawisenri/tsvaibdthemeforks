# t'svai's ~~bd theme fork~~ theme asset repo

For a while now, vencord has been able to use local themes instead of exclusively online themes, so I no longer need this as a theme css repo, and am now using it to host assets for any themes that use images (background themes, etc).

~~As (partially) noted in the repo description these are all self-customized versions of betterdiscord themes that are reuploaded for use on vencord.~~ 

~~It's all betterdiscord currently (and actually one theme currently) but could potentially end up including other sources as well.~~

~~I don't actually expect/intend for anyone else to look at this or use it, but I dumped this readme here anyway in case anyone stumbles across it.~~

**Disclaimer:** All edited and reuploaded themes will still have the sources & credits in the css as originally put there by their creators. I have done my best to check licenses before saving and reuploading to make sure they permit distribution and/or private use. 

*All themes are bound by the original/term licenses of the repos they were sourced from.*
